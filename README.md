## Circuit Design

The schematic mainly consists of four main parts:

- **Adder Circuit**
- **Subtractor Circuit**
- **Multiplier Circuit**
- **Gain and DC Shift Adjustment**

### Adder Circuit

The adder circuit combines two input signals using operational amplifiers (op-amps). It features a summing amplifier to add the signals and an inverting amplifier to adjust the outputâ€™s polarity and gain. The summing amplifier produces a weighted sum of the inputs, while the inverting amplifier refines the signal, allowing for precise control over the final output.
